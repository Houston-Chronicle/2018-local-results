# 2018 County Results page
This is a single-page application built by the Houston Chronicle for 2018 general electio results. This app will serve as a way for readers to see who won in the downballot races in the eight-county region the Chronicle covers. The design and functionality are based heavly on the [2018 Regional Ballot](https://github.com/Houston-Chronicle/2018-regional-ballot).
## Why and how we built this
We built this app for people to see who won in the local races that don't get much media attention. Our data team requested results from the different couties in spreadsheets after the election was over and we were able to obtain unofficial results. Once we got all eight counties, we pulled the results into a CSV file and converted that into JSON, forming the backbone of the application.
## What we built this with
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) made up the backbone of this app, with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) acting as the CSS framework.
